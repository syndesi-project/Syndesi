Introduction
============

Syndesi is a Python package designed to facilitate reliable communication with electronic devices like Arduinos, lab equipment (e.g., multimeters, oscilloscopes, waveform generators), and servers via standard protocols.

The package aims to simplify testbench creation for engineers, hobbyists, and educators, providing a unified interface for various connection types (IP, SerialPort, VISA) and data formatting protocols (Delimited, SCPI, Modbus).

**Main Features:**
- Simple interface for establishing connections
- Support for multiple communication protocols
- Extensible design for adding new protocols or device-specific drivers
