# TODO list

- [ ] Find a way to make easy threding with device commands, N functions should be launched at the same time and their result returned simultaneously
- [ ] Run functions in the background
- [ ] Make looping possible on device functions, for example a user should be able to do ``waveform_generator.set_output_state([1, 2], True)`` (or similar) to enable both channels simultaneously
