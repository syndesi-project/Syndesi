        A class to manage timeouts

        Timeouts are split in three categories :
        - response timeout : the "standard" timeout, (i.e the time it takes for
            a device to start transmitting data)
        - continuation timeout : the time between reception of
            data units (bytes or blocks of data)
        - total timeout : maximum time from start to end of transmission.
            This timeout can stop a communication mid-way. It is used to
            prevent a host from getting stuck reading a constantly streaming device

        Parameters
        ----------
        response : float
        continuation : float
        total : float
        data_strategy : Mode
            Strategy of data processing upon timeout event.
            - DataStrategy.DISCARD : All of the data received after a timeout event is discarded
            - DataStrategy.RETAIN : All of the data received after a timeout event is retained and
                will be read on the next read() call
