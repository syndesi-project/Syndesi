# Adapters provide a common abstraction for the media layers (physical + data link + network)
# The following classes are provided, which all are derived from the main Adapter class 
#   - IP
#   - Serial
#   - VISA
# 
# Note that technically VISA is not part of the media layer, only USB is.
# This is a limitation as it is to this day not possible to communication "raw"
# with a device through USB yet
#
#
#
#
# Timeout system
# We can differentiate two kinds of timeout :
#   - transmission timeout (aka "timeout"): the time it takes for a device to start transmitting what we expect
#   - continuation timeout : the time it takes for a device to continue sending the requested data
